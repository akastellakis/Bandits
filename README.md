# Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms Notebook

This is a self-explanatory Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and comparison of three popular bandit algorithms that achieve sublinear regret: Epsilon-Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and the Hedge algorithm. The notebook provides an interactive environment to observe the behavior and performance of each algorithm.

## Preparation

1. Upload the notebook file `Bandits.ipynb` to your Google Drive storage, and then open the notebook using Google Colab.

2. Upload the dataset file `Milano_timeseries.csv` in the same folder with the notebook. 

## Code run

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Mount the drive.

2. Copy the path of the dataset and add it in the `genfromtxt` command.

3. Run the the notebook by pressing `Runtime` -> `Run all` from Google Colab toolbar.
